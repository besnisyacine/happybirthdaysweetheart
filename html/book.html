      غريب حقا هذا الحب لم اكن اعلم ان طرقنا ستلتقي يوما ما دون مخطط لم اعرف متى وقعت في حبك لكن يمكن وصفه بالسقوط بهدوء في بحر دافئ منذ مدة كل واحد منا يعيش حياته لا احد يعرف بوجود الاخر و مع ذلك وسط هذا العدد من الناس وسط هذا الزحام التقيت بك افضل صدفة لي كل يوم تكلمنا فيه افكر في نفسي كيف لشخص مثلك التواجد في العالم شخص انا سعيد بمناداتها فتات احلامي بحق كمية ذكائك تصرفاتك كلامك كل شيء مميز فيك و كله يخرج في انا شخصية ماشفتها من زمان هذه شخصيتي الحقيقية اذا صح القول فقبلك كان كل شيء مزيف تمثيل احاول اندمج مع مجتمع ضعيف و منغلق لدرجة نسيت نفسي من اكون لكن انتي رجعتيني لي خليتيني ارتاح و اتكلم و ان اكون على طبيعتي دون ان ابرر او اخاف باختصار جعلتيني اقوى و اكثر إدراكً لما انا عليه و ما انا قادر عليه

             We became friends—not instantly, not dramatically, just effortlessly. She was chaos and light, and I was quiet and steady. Somehow, we just… fit.<br><br><br>
             She’d text me random questions:<br>
            <i>"If you could be anywhere right now, where would you be?"</i><br><br><br>
            And I’d reply:<br>
            <i>"Probably home. It’s comfortable."</i>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="back">
          <p><br><br>
            Then she’d send,
            <i>"Wrong answer. The correct answer is: anywhere but home, with me."</i><br><br>

            I should’ve known then. I should’ve seen the way she was pulling me into her world, piece by piece.

            I wanted to tell her today. That she wasn’t just my best friend. That when she laughed, the world made sense. That her voice was my favorite sound. That I was in love with her.<br><br>

            She doesn’t know. She’ll never know. And maybe that’s for the best.<br><br>
            She calls me her <i>“favorite person.”</i> I wish she knew what that did to me.

            She’s happy. That should be enough, right?<br><br>

            If you love someone, you want them to be happy—even if their happiness doesn’t include you.<br><br>

            I saw her today, standing in the rain, laughing like she belonged in it. And suddenly, it hit me:<br><br>
            
            <b>She’s not mine to love. She never was.</b><br><br>          

            Maybe one day, I’ll meet someone whose laugh feels like home, who looks at me the way I look at her. Maybe.<br><br>

            Until then, I’ll keep writing.<br><br>
            
            For her. For me. For the love story that never was.

            She was never mine to keep. But the love? That was real. And that’s enough.<br><br>

            So this is my final entry. Not because the story ends here, but because it’s time to start a new one."<br><br>
