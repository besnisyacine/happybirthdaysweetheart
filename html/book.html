             We became friends—not instantly, not dramatically, just effortlessly. She was chaos and light, and I was quiet and steady. Somehow, we just… fit.<br><br><br>
             She’d text me random questions:<br>
            <i>"If you could be anywhere right now, where would you be?"</i><br><br><br>
            And I’d reply:<br>
            <i>"Probably home. It’s comfortable."</i>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="back">
          <p><br><br>
            Then she’d send,
            <i>"Wrong answer. The correct answer is: anywhere but home, with me."</i><br><br>

            I should’ve known then. I should’ve seen the way she was pulling me into her world, piece by piece.

            I wanted to tell her today. That she wasn’t just my best friend. That when she laughed, the world made sense. That her voice was my favorite sound. That I was in love with her.<br><br>

            She doesn’t know. She’ll never know. And maybe that’s for the best.<br><br>
            She calls me her <i>“favorite person.”</i> I wish she knew what that did to me.

            She’s happy. That should be enough, right?<br><br>

            If you love someone, you want them to be happy—even if their happiness doesn’t include you.<br><br>

            People say, <i><b>"Time heals everything."</i></b><br><br>

            I saw her today, standing in the rain, laughing like she belonged in it. And suddenly, it hit me:<br><br>
            
            <b>She’s not mine to love. She never was.</b><br><br>          

            Maybe one day, I’ll meet someone whose laugh feels like home, who looks at me the way I look at her. Maybe.<br><br>

            Until then, I’ll keep writing.<br><br>
            
            For her. For me. For the love story that never was.

            She was never mine to keep. But the love? That was real. And that’s enough.<br><br>

            So this is my final entry. Not because the story ends here, but because it’s time to start a new one."<br><br>
